"""SQLite scaffolding — connection helper, idempotent init, and a place
to put your schema.

This file is intentionally tiny. It gives you:

- A `DB_PATH` that env-var-overrides for tests / alternate deployments.
- A `SCHEMA` string containing the project's tables (CREATE TABLE IF
  NOT EXISTS so it's safe to run on every import).
- `init_db()` — idempotent.
- `get_conn()` — context-managed connection with `Row` factory and
  auto-commit/rollback semantics.

The example schema below is a single `kv` table — replace it with your
own. For larger projects, switch `SCHEMA` to a list of migration files
loaded from a `core/migrations/` directory.

When you outgrow SQLite (concurrent writers, real users, > ~10k rows of
hot data), swap to Postgres: change the connection function, keep the
context-manager surface. The SQL is usually portable enough that schema
+ queries don't change.
